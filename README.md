# Wikipedia Viewer - React.JS

This is a project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. It uses the Wikipedia API to search for multiple Wikipedia pages by term or randomly. 

I used React.js for state and app management and learned how to combine it with API calls. In this version I also touched up the design and UX. 

## To Do

* Web Scrap to gain additional data about the random articles - the Wikipedia API does not have much in this regard on its own. 

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

### Personal

* User Story: The random Wikipedia entries are also generated in a list rather than individual. Also the wikipedia entries open in a new page. 
* User Story: Have a different message for when the user has not entered anything or no articles can be found
* User Story: Update the search results in real time as the user is typing into the search bar - and move it to the top when the user is working. 
* User Story: Clear all articles button.
